Find the main repository [here](https://github.com/CatoThe1stElder/WFRP-4th-Edition-FoundryVTT)

## Homebrew changes
Changes are divided into system changes (involving actual changes to the wfrp4e implementation in Foundry) and soft changes, which don't require implementation.

### System Changes
* Advantage does not add +10, it instead adds + 1 SL on successful Tests per advantage, just like Talents. (Todo)

* Overcasts are announced prior to casting (I want to overcast my Bolt's range), this adds to the CN needed to cast the spell. (Todo - extensive change)

* Spells damage is now based off SL - CN, instead of just SL (Todo)

* Change rolling range from 1-100 to 00-99 (Symmetrical auto-critical and auto-fumble). (Todo - Considering)

* Advantage applies to neither Casting nor Channelling, but you do receive it from casting as normal (Todo - Possibly will allow it to apply to Channelling)

* Partial Channelling (implemented as an optional system rule for everyone)

* Motivation is removed. You get 1 Resolve for completing your Short Term Ambition. You get 1 Resilience for completing your Long Term Ambition. (Todo)

### Soft Changes
TODO
