Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and oﬀers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>For every step larger than Medium, a creature counts as +1 creature for the sake of being outnumbered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>You gain a hefty bonus when shooting at larger targets, but for every +10 you receive, you subtract 1 from your damage. (Ex. +40 to hit Enormous, -4 Damage).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"rollable":{"value":false,"label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":""},"specification":{"value":"Size","type":"String","label":"Specification"}},"folder":"Il8t365W3mzOjutn","flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"type":"trait","img":"systems/wfrp4e/icons/blank.png"}

When causing Fear in this way, you may subsequently use your Animal Training Skill instead of Melee when defending against your target; with your GM’s approval you may also use Animal Training to attack your target, issuing specific commands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Animals</span></h3>\n<p>Whether a creature does, or does not come under the auspices of animal care and animal training is up to your GM.
